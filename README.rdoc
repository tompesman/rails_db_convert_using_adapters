= convert.rake

Updated to work with Ruby on Rails 3.1.0-rc4.

Rake task to convert and transfer a Rails database from one database
platform to another using two open db adapters.  For example,
from Postgres to MySQL, or the reverse.

The task deletes all data in the development database and then
transfers the data from the production database into the development
database.

== Features
* Nice to RAM on large data sets
* Works with blobs

== Assumptions
* No writes are happening to either database for the duration of this task.
* Both schemas are identical (i.e. migrations are at the same VERSION)
* The development data can be removed and replaced.


== Usage
For a detailed example please see: http://myutil.com/2008/8/31/rake-task-transfer-rails-database-mysql-to-postgres
